# Collect-the-Hearts
Moves on a square grid, with independent jumps.

Instructions:

1. Goal: Collect 5 hearts scattered on the board by moving the character towards the hearts. The positions of the hearts are generated randomly. The top of the window shows how many of the 5 hearts have been collected. If a heart gets collected by the character, the heart will move up and float above the board. The main character cannot move outside of the wall/boundary.

2. Moving: Use "W"/"up" keys to move the character forward; use "S"/"down" keys to move the character backward.

3. Turning: Use "A"/"left" keys to make the character turn left by 90 degrees; use "D"/"right" keys to make the character turn right by 90 degrees.

3. Arm Movements: Hit "1" to rotate the left lower arm, and "4" to rotate the right lower arm. Hit "2" to move the left upper arm, and "3" to move the right upper arm. Whenever you move an upper arm, the corresponding lower arm will follow.
